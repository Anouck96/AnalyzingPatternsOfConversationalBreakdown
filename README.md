# Analyzing Patterns Of Conversational Breakdown

This repository contains the code and (anonymous) data for the paper "Analyzing Patterns of Conversational Breakdown in Human-Chatbot Customer Service Conversations".

## Data

- all_data_anonymous_test.csv. This data file contains featurizations for the test data (utterances before a repair).
- nonrepair_features_nobuttons_anon.csv This data file contains featurization for a random control data set which consists out of utterances that do not occur together with a repair. This selection also removed some utterances that were buttons.
- finalfeatanonymoussesID.csv Contains a larger selection of featurized utterances before and after repairs (labeled 'sorry' and 'helaas') and a bot response to a complaint (labeled 'vervelend').
